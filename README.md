Hi, I'm BG2CNT, formely known as aerglass.

I code for fun at times. Mostly C++ and BlocksDS stuff. I don't have the best experience but I do have a lot of fun

# Projects I did or am doing:
- **Azaiz:** a 2D platformer that started off as a concept of a engine which can load game files from filesystem, but now expanded into something much bigger, and I honestly like this.
- **PAlib updates:** I updated PAlib for a while, but then I retired from doing it, the lib worked fine until calico but AntonioND ported it to BlocksDS using my codebase (https://github.com/antoniond/palib)
